###  AeroGear Cordova Push Plugin release

### Hi all,

After testing and finding some small issues we are happy to announce that the 1.0.0 version of the Cordova push plugin has been released. Thanks to everyone for testing and making this release happen.

We now have support for background notifications, have a look at the [quickstarts][2] for use of this feature.
