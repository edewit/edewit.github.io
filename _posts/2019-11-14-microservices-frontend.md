So I've been involved with [Quarkus](http://quarkus.io/) especially their code generator site code.quarkus.io.
Now I'm impressed with this project and I think it could be really big.
Java is, for a lot of companies, a language that they invested big in, but for making microservices not ideal, due to the larger memory footprint.
With quarkus, this and startup time, has been reduced dramatically.

I still see some problems with putting front-ends on microservices as I've described in my [previous post][1]
So as an exercise I'll try and use the great method described by [micro-frontends][2] and apply it to this [example microservice][3] that ales made.
By doing so I'll hope to learn something and maybe find out some shortcomings.

Stay tuned to see how it goes.
