###  DevTools

All of my javascript colleges already knew this probably, but I just found out today that the DevTools on Chrome Canary are so great that you can use it as IDE. They have added a way to save files to disk and automatic reload. So what I used to do is load up an page and change the css styles in the inspector because it didn't look right. Then copy those changes and put them in my css. Of course then I forget a couple that then are lost on reload. But now all changes are saved automatically even the ones that you make in the inspector that is to awesome for words.  
  
For more information about the [DevTools][2] in [Chrome Canary][3] have a look at this [talk][4] and documentation.
