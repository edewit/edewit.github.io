We have released a new version of the cordova push plugin the new version 1.0.2 a new feature is support for external configuration. Now instead of using code you can store the variantId and secrets into a separate json file. With more platforms support coming this will not `pollute` your code anymore.

Check out the 1.0.x branch to give it a spin. Here are the release notes:
