![me][me]
From a very young age I’ve been interested in computers and I wrote my first program at the age of 12 without owning a computer myself.
Even today I’m always looking at new technologies, to see if we can solve things differently, maybe even better.
Because I’m very enthusiastic about technology, I like to exchange thoughts and knowledge with others.
I do this by talking at conferences or writing blogs here.
